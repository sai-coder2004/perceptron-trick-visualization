# perceptron-trick-visualization
A visual implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib animations. Ideal for beginners to understand linear classification through live training boundary updates.

🧠 Perceptron Trick – Visual Learning with Jupyter Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the Perceptron Learning Algorithm, a foundational method in machine learning for binary classification using linear decision boundaries.

It combines hands-on coding with a matplotlib animation to visually track the model's decision boundary as it learns over time.
